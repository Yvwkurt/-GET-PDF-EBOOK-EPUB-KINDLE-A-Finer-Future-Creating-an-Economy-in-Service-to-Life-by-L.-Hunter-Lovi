The blueprint for an inspiring regenerative economy that avoids collapse and works for people and the planet.

Humanity is in a race with catastrophe. Is the future one of global warming, 65 million migrants fleeing failed states, soaring inequality, and grid-locked politics? Or one of empowered entrepreneurs and innovators working towards social change, leveling the playing field, and building a world that works for everyone? While the specter of collapse looms large, A Finer Future demonstrates that humanity has a chance - just - to thread the needle of sustai

Rating: 5.0 out of 5 stars
Title: An Electrifying Set of Facts, Insights, and Solutions
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on November 21, 2020
Review: I found this book exciting. A Finer Future delivers concentrated facts, analyses and real-world innovations that instantly get us past the often ill-informed and misleading "political debate" over climate change and sustainable business practices. The book is so focused and practical that it makes you want get up and get something useful done. It quickly reveals that "green" and sustainable policies are not liberal pie-in-the-sky fantasies that would ruin the economy, as some unaware folks and vested interests like to claim, and that instead they advance hard-nosed, profit-driven, job-creating, free commerce principles, and the spirit of independence and entrepreneurship at the core of American values. Written by four of the most influential thought leaders in the accelerating sustainability movement, this book is galvanizing because it lights the way forward, toward a more practical, profitable, survivable, healthy and innovative future for us all. I couldn't put it down, and then it got me looking into more.

Title: Hearts in the right place, poor execution
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on March 8, 2020
Review: I was actually very disappointed by this book. Which is a shame, because I looking forward to it coming out since I first heard about it several years ago. As a student of these topics and as an engineer and sustainability consultant, I am always looking for well-researched references that I can lean on when arguing for making changes to the status quo in business and the built environment. While I agree with the intent of the book, the quality of the arguments being made are just not where they need to be if we want to change anybody's mind. (Maybe they are good enough for the echo chamber of people who already believe in this movement.) In fact, I feel like I walked away from many of the sections with a poorer understanding than when I started.

I think my biggest complaint would be the references. You can tell a lot about the quality of a book by the references they use, and this text used very basic references. For example, many of the "facts" they use to support the arguments being made come from a simple web search or a news article they found online (and by some clearly biased news organizations). One author appears to site a lot of his own previous writing as evidence to support the arguments he is making, a form of circular logic that is easy to pick apart. And just as a pet peeve, there are frequent grammar errors that should have been easily caught by the editors, which is frustrating for a book that was being worked on for so long.

In summary, I am sad to admit that I would not recommend this book to anybody who is serious about making change to the status quo - exactly the kinds of changes that are called for in this book. I cannot trust the references being used to build up their arguments, and therefore I cannot use this book as a foundation for building a movement. I must continue my research elsewhere.

Title: A book that presents a path forward in these dark times
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on May 3, 2019
Review: I use this book in a course I teach at the University of Denver. Students like the book because it is realistic about the social, economic, and environmental problems we face - and describes them succinctly and clearly; however, it then proceeds to describe solutions that already exist and simply need to be fostered and other solutions that are possible. My students are typically environmentally aware and concerned but they are exhausted with elaborate and repetitive descriptions of the problems. They yearn for solutions they can take part in. This book tackles that challenge.

Title: A much needed vision in an imperiled world.
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on April 25, 2019
Review: This book does what too few books attempt: paint a picture of a present-day world where business, technology, politics, etc., can actually be harnessed to create a better (even shining) future. It does so with massively researched, briskly written prose. Sign me up for this any day.

Review: Just when you thought climate change and the global economy were spiraling out of control, this book does a wonderful job of painting a more hopeful and regenerative future. Well written, with many real-life examples of positive change in process. Highly recommend.
